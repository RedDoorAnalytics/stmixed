TITLE: `STMIXED' : module to fit multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: stmixed fits multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models using maximum 
likelihood. The distribution of the random effects can be Gaussian or t-distributed. Adaptive or non-adaptive 
Gauss-Hermite quadrature or Monte-Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the likelihood. 
Parametric survival models available include the exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz proportional hazards models, 
the generalised gamma, log normal and log logistic AFT models, the Royston-Parmar flexible parametric survival 
model and its log hazard scale equivalent, or a user-defined general hazard function. Relative survival models 
can be fitted and delayed entry/left truncation is supported.
