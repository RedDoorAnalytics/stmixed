TITLE: `STMIXED' : module to fit multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: stmixed fits multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models using maximum 
likelihood. The distribution of the random effects can be Gaussian or t-distributed. Adaptive or non-adaptive 
Gauss-Hermite quadrature or Monte-Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the likelihood. 
Parametric survival models available include the exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz proportional hazards models, 
the Royston-Parmar flexible parametric survival model and its log hazard scale equivalent, or a user-defined 
general hazard function. Relative survival models can be fitted and delayed entry/left truncation is supported.
