TITLE: `STMIXED' : module to fit multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: stmixed fits multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models using maximum likelihood. The distribution of the random effects is assumed 
to be Gaussian. Adaptive or non-adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature is used to evaluate the likelihood. Parametric survival models available include 
the exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz proportional hazards models, log-logistic, log-normal, and generalised gamma accelerated failure time models, 
and the Royston-Parmar flexible parametric survival model. Currently only two levels in the model are supported. The random effects are included in 
the linear predictor on the log hazard scale for proportional hazards models, and the log time scale for accelerated failure time models. In particular, 
stmixed provides normally distributed frailties as an alternative to those implemented in streg (gamma and inverse normal), as well as allowing 
random slopes.
